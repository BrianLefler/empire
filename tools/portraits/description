Pipeline:

2. Take source images. Identify portrait regions, using portrait-finder.html. When done (or saving progress), save and overwrite data.js with the file.
3. When done, execute run.sh to create PNG images from each of the portrait regions, downsampling if necessary.
4. Then, run portrait-classifer.html to bucketize the images by quality. Save the data as taggingdata.js.
